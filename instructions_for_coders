Instructions for coding

Open the excel file, "for coding". You will be rating each item in column B for if it contains various things. Put your rating ('1') in columns C:E, as follows:

Column C: If the person in B mentions a physical behavioural strategy, an action that you would probably be able to approximately copy from their description.

Examples: YES:

    He gently moved a grey ball close to the others
    He threw the balls at each other
    Knocking them around
    He let the balls sink to the bottom
    Used A to push B

NO:

    He tested the balls
    The balls kept getting closer
    The balls attracted each other (because this describes the ball's properties, not the person's behaviour)

Column D: If B mentions the end goal of what the person was trying to find out.

Examples: YES:

    He was testing the force
    He was seeing whether they attract or repel
    He was seeing which was heavier
    Clear test for force
    Clear test for mass

NO:

    It wasn't force so it must have been mass (and other 'logic' type of answer that result from the binary forced choice design)

Column E: If B mentions a more specific goal, such as a distinctive action to isolate one property (e.g. attract v repel), or tell what movement or behaviour they were testing.

YES:

    He did xx to see if they repel
    To see if they would attract without getting bashed about

NO:

    He was seeing whether they attract or repel
    He moved the balls to see how they react

The following types of answer get NO rating in any column:

    A was heavier
    The balls repelled
    The grey balls were close to the bottom
    No clue
